Executive Summary:
1 page (max) summary of feedback and changes made to this Project from initial version until now.
Note that summary is different from previous steps which asked for copy/paste of feedback and your response. 
Executive summary has facts about the database being documented as opposed to about the report you created.
In this step we expect a short 1 page (max) reflection on major changes to this project from your initial proposal to now and what feedback influenced those changes. 
We expect to find this section on feedback in the PDF that you turn in the .ZIP file.

Project and Database Outlines: 
The updated versions of the Project and Database outline. Reading these should give a layman the complete idea of your Project and it's universe and thus be able to navigate the website.

ER Diagram: 
The updated version of your ERD using the notations that we use in the class.

Schema:
The updated version of the schema that should follow the database outline exactly. It will again be graded on the extent to which it matches the outline with an emphasis on if relationships and keys are set up correctly. Again, please stick to the notations that we use in the class.

Data Definition Queries:
The updated version of SQL file that you provide should be cleanly import-able on the database Server that is used to host your CS340 database. If the .SQL file cannot be imported or does not create tables as your Schema describes, using PHPMyAdmin or the MySQL command line client, you will lose all of these points.

Data Manipulation Queries: 
The updated version of the SQL file which provides all your DML queries in the format described in Step 4. You will lose points if you don't have queries providing the functionalities listed in the CS340 Project Guide.

Website Functionality:
All the functionalities described in the CS340 Project Guide should be implemented.
When dealing with relationships you cannot expect the user to manually type any data. You should allow the user to select things to relate to each other via drop-down menus or some other UI element where the user picks from existing items to add them to a relationship. When picking items you should display the name that makes the most sense to the user. This is very likely not the primary key. For example, in context of the BSG database, when adding a row to the relation between bsg_people and bsg_cert, we would expect the bsg_cert.title values to be shown in a dropdown/set of radio button instead of allowing entry of bsg_cert.id
The URL of the website should be included in the PDF as well as a comment on the submission.

READ/BROWSE/DISPLAY page

CREATE/INSERT/ADD NEW pages

DELETE functionality

EDIT/UPDATE functionality

SEARCH/FILTER functionality 

Style: 
Your website should be reasonably easy to navigate. We are not expecting CSS. But tabular data should be displayed in tables and form elements should be reasonably grouped. Section headers for parts of your pages/forms would definitely make your site easier to navigate.
Your write-up in the PDF should be well formatted and divided into sections for easy navigation and readability.
Your SQL files should have brief comments mentioning what functionality/entity/relationship the query is related to.
